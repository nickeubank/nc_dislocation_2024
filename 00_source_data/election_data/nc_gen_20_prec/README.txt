## Notes on Field Names (adapted from VEST):
Columns reporting votes generally follow the pattern: 
The first character is G for a general election, P for a primary, S for a special, and R for a runoff.
Characters 2 and 3 are the year of the election.
Characters 4-6 represent the office type (see list below).
Character 7 represents the party of the candidate.
Characters 8-10 are the first three letters of the candidate's last name.
One example is:
G16PREDCLI

To fit within the GIS 10 character limit for field names, the naming convention is slightly different for the State Legislature and 
US House of Representatives. All fields are listed below with definitions.
The pound/hash symbol (#) is used to represent a district number.

## Processing Steps  
The RDH joined additional election results to VEST's existing precinct shapefile, including the US House of Representatives, State House of Representatives, and State Senate. The statewide results come from VEST's original file. VEST's original file included results for President, U.S. Senate, Governor, Lieutenant General, Attorney General, Treasurer, Secretary of State, Auditor, Agriculture Commissioner, Insurance Commissioner, Labor Commissioner, Superintendent of Public Instruction, State Supreme Court, State Appeals Court.
To follow VEST's processing, absentee, provisional, and other county-wide votes were allocated to precincts in the county based on candidate performance.
In instances where precincts are split across legislative or congressional districts, precincts were intersected with the districts and votes were assigned accordingly. Since both Congressional and State House districts split precincts, two additional shapefiles are created with a unique ID the specifies the original precinct name as well as the corresponding district ID.
Indepdent and Write-In candidates are grouped together by contest.

## Additional Notes
Included in this zip folder are three shapefiles (and their supporting files): nc_gen_20_st_sldu_prec.shp, nc_gen_20_cong_prec.shp, nc_gen_sldl_prec.shp
North Carolina produces two sets of election results data. The precinct results are the unaltered results as initially reported by the counties. Many counties report early votes by vote center while provisional and other nonstandard ballots may be reported countywide. The precinct-sorted results are then produced within 30 days after the election. In the precinct-sorted data nearly all votes are assigned to precincts regardless of the manner by which the ballots were cast. However, North Carolina law requires the addition of statistical "noise" to the precinct-sorted data wherever any given vote by any specific voter may otherwise be deduced via cross referencing the various election-related data sets produced by the SBE.
For the 2020 general election 51 counties reported all votes by precinct in their initial precinct results. The precinct-sorted data set was used instead for the counties listed below:
Alleghany, Avery, Beaufort, Bertie*, Bladen, Buncombe, Cabarrus, Caldwell, Camden, Currituck, Dare, Davidson*, Davie, Duplin*, Durham*, Edgecombe, Guilford, Halifax*, Harnett, Haywood, Henderson, Hertford, Hyde, Johnston, Jones, Lee, Lincoln, Macon, Martin, Mecklenburg*, Moore, Nash, New Hanover*, Northampton*, Orange, Pasquotank, Pitt*, Polk, Richmond, Scotland, Stokes*, Surry*, Tyrrell*, Wake, Washington, Watauga, Wayne, Wilkes*, Yadkin
In counties marked by asterisk some votes were still reported by vote center or countywide in the precinct-sorted data. These were distributed by candidate to precincts based on the precinct-level reported vote. The precinct-sorted results were further adjusted to match the certified countywide totals based on the precinct-level vote by candidate (fields that start with G20 only).
Due to the injected noise, precinct results will may not sum to match exact totals at the state level. Noting this, the RDH produced file sums to results within reason for the given contests. The RDH also performed geospatial verifications to confirm splits were being performed correctly.

The RDH validated final results by checking against state files and VEST's original file as applicable.
